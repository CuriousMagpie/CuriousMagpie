### Hi there, friendo ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on a portfolio website, lovingly coded by hand. It's artisinal, small batch HTML/CSS. But definitely *not* organic.
- ðŸ¤–  It's not organic because I am a cyborg. Beep boop!
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Front end development, including Django and JavaScript (including React).
  - Python
  - WordPress child theme development
- ðŸ‘¯  I'd love to collaborate with you on open source projects that have a community focus and benefit. Not looking to "disrupt" anything, but to make existing spaces more equitable and accessible.
- ðŸ˜„  Pronouns: she/her/they/them
- âš¡  Fun fact: I was a finalist for the Hugo for Best Fan Writer in 2017 and I blog at [Pretty Terrible](https://www.pretty-terrible.com/) (note that the template needs a *serious* refresh)
- âš¡  Another fun fact: I'm a finalist for the 2021 Hugo for Best Related Work for my essay about yeeting George R.R. Martin into the sun.
